		 * whose target anchors are all absent - which does happen, and would
		 * otherwise report "undetermined" for want of looking rather than for want
		 * of evidence.
		 *
		 * Short strings are avoided: a two-character literal widened to UTF-32 is
		 * eight bytes of mostly zeros, which matches padding all over the image.
