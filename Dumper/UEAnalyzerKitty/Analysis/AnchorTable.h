		/// helper, so the disassembly reads
		///
		///     ADRL X1, dword_...        ; the UTF-32 name data
		///     SUB  X0, X29, #-var_48    ; a *stack local*, not the pool

		/// for a global inside the anchored function therefore finds the wrong

		/// Following the call argument finds the real one, and stack locals are
		/// rejected for free by the writable-global test.
