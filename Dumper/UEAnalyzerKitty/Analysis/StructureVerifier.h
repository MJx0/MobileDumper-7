	 * test, or ObjObjectsStrategy's VerifyObjectArrayShape). This class exists
	 * for cache lifetime, not sharing: SortedGlobals()/HotTableThreshold() are
	 * each read by one strategy today but cost an O(n log n) pass over every
	 * global, and Score() calls Verify() once per candidate. Caching on the
	 * strategy instance instead would be wrong - verify_truths and
	 * explain_reserved_names both reuse one set of strategies across many
	 * different binaries - so a StructureVerifier is built fresh per query and
	 * discarded, keeping the cache's lifetime pinned to the one Harvester it
	 * was built from.
