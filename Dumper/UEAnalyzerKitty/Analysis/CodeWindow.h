	 * @brief A sliding, buffered view over instruction bytes.
	 *
	 * Replaces handing out a raw pointer into a mapped file. A live process cannot
	 * produce such a pointer, so every decode read goes through IMemory::ReadBytes
	 * and is buffered here in large chunks - the per-instruction cost stays a
	 * bounds check and a pointer add, while the transport stays portable.
	 *
	 * A failed read returns nullptr, which is also how a scan discovers the end of
	 * readable content. That matters for a file image, where a segment's
	 * non-file-backed tail (.bss) deliberately fails rather than reading as zeros,
	 * and it means callers need no notion of "file size" to know where to stop -
	 * useful because .bss is not reliably the last thing in a module.
