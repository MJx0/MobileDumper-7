	 * @brief Finds many string literals in a single pass over memory.

	 * Searching every literal the analyzer looks for on its own - each anchor,
	 * each TCHAR probe, each resolution string, in ASCII *and* UTF-16 *and*
	 * UTF-32 - would mean dozens of separate passes over the image per
	 * Analyze(), each walking the module from the start.
	 *
	 * Against a mapped file that many passes are memchr over resident pages and
	 * merely slow. Against a live process each pass drags the module through the
	 * transport again, which is enough reads to make the analyzer unusable at
	 * runtime.
	 *
	 * So the needles are collected first and the bytes are walked once. Memory
	 * stays bounded: one chunk is held at a time, never a snapshot of the module,
	 * and chunks overlap by the longest needle minus one byte so a literal lying
	 * across a boundary is still found.
