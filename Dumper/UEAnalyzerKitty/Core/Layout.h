	/// Kind is the strategy's own name for the shape it found (e.g. "FNamePool",
	/// "FUObjectArray") - free-form rather than a shared enum, since the set of
	/// nameable shapes grows with the set of strategies, and a shared enum would
	/// need editing every time a strategy is added. Empty means undetermined.
	///
	/// The engine version is never read, so the kind is a reading of the access
	/// shape and not a fact about the build. Callers that must not guess should
	/// require a Confidence they are comfortable with, or accept an unknown kind.
