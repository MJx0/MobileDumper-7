	 * @brief The name table - FNamePool / NamePoolData, or legacy GNames.
	 *
	 * One strategy covers both structures. They score the same candidates, and the
	 * only thing that would separate them is an engine-version prior - a claim
	 * this tool has no way to check. Which one an address reads as is reported
	 * instead, through StructureEvidence::Layout.
	 *
	 * The name table is much harder to find statically than the object array, and
	 * the scoring reflects that: no single signal separates it. What does show is
	 * a distinctive profile - the table is typically reached at exactly one
	 * offset, its access count sits in a narrow band rather than being large,
	 * and it is referenced from code that also mentions FName's own diagnostic
	 * strings.
