	 * @brief GUObjectArray - the FUObjectArray that holds the object array.
	 *
	 * A separate target from ObjObjects, not another name for it. The two are used
	 * differently and that difference is what makes both worth locating: the array
	 * is reached through pointer-width reads, while the container's address is taken
	 * and passed as `this`.
	 *
	 * The container is the more robust of the two on obfuscated builds, where it
	 * can be referenced orders of magnitude more than the array inside it -
	 * exactly the case where locating the member on its own evidence fails.
