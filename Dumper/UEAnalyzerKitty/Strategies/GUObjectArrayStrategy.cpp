		 * function operates on is the container and the array is a field of it.
		 *
		 * Trust values are scored for this target separately from the member - a
		 * value that stops holding here shows up independently of whether it still
		 * holds for the member. Anchors that resolve correctly too rarely are
		 * deleted, not down-weighted, since a single confident wrong resolution is
		 * worse than an absent one.
		 *
		 * The container is referenced by more distinct strings than the member is,
		 * including a whole GC-settings vocabulary the member never sees, but that
		 * surplus is breadth, not resolution: a settings or lifecycle function
		 * touches too much engine state for the derivation to reliably pick the
		 * array out of it. Those strings still pay off in ProximityAnchors, which
		 * is scored on breadth, and not here.
