	 * @brief FUObjectArray - GUObjectArray / ObjObjects.
	 *
	 * One strategy covers both layouts. They score identically - the chunk-constant
	 * signal that distinguishes them is fitted to weight 0 - so which one an
	 * address reads as is reported through StructureEvidence::Layout rather than
	 * decided by an engine-version prior this tool cannot check.
	 *
	 * The scoring shape says something real about the target: the object array is
	 * the global whose accesses are almost entirely pointer-width and which is
	 * touched at only a handful of distinct offsets. Raw reference count barely
	 * matters - several engine singletons are hotter.
